# Tictactoe

Hello there!

## Setup
To play the game, install first some packages

- I have used python `3.11.3` but older ones should work fine.
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` will dowload and install the required packages

#### OpenAI API key
To be able to play against the bot, you will need to setup a `API key` in your `PATH` variables.
